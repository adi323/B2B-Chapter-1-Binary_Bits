Gopaal is going in a car at x kmph. (10 <= x <= 500). We know nobody can drive at this speed range, but Gopaal can.

Gopaal can manage to turn and avoid the truck when he is driving at 30 kmph or less.

A truck is coming right in front of him at y kmph. (5 <= y <= 60)
Also, the truck driver can avoid Gopaal's car when it is going at 20 kmph or less.

Calculate the probability of Gopaal dying right under the truck.

Conclusion: There is a high chance of Gopaal to die. Don't be like Gopaal.

Input format:
The first line of input will be T (1 <= T <= 100), the number of test cases.
Next T lines denotes one test case.
The first line of each test case will contain x and y, respectively, separated by space.

Output format:
There will be T output lines (as there are T test cases).
The output for each test case will be either 1 (RIP Gopaal) or 0 (Gopaal is alive).

Make sure you follow this exact input and output format.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
10 <= x <= 500
5 <= y <= 60


Examples:
Input:
2
310 40
28 30

Output:
1
0

Explanation:
Test case 1: Neither Gopaal nor the truck can turn their vehicle. RIP Gopaal and the truck driver is severly injured.
Test case 2: Gopaal turns his car and prepares for his next daring journey.
